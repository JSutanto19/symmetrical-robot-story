    "With great power comes great responsibility" these were the words that his master said before teaching him the ways of mixed martial arts. At this very 
moment,no words could express his excitement and so he nodded his head vigorously.His pupils dilated, his grin turned into a wide smile and this moment felt 
surreal. Ever since Jack was young he had dreamed of becoming a world-renown mixed martial artist. He watched every televised UFC fight 
and had posters of the league's best fighters on his bedroom wall. As he was watching those matches, he imagined being in the octagon, fighting for his pride
, honor, the crowd chanting his name and he could feel the adrenaline martial arts brought to his life. To Jack, martial arts was not a sport to entertain the
 masses, it was his lifelong dream. He realized that this was the first step to attaining the life he fantasizes about.
    Jack had three eyes. He lived in a rural town in the middle of ireland. He loved exploring the country side until on
e day he found a cave. Initially he was excited to explore said cave until he went in and was attacked by a gaggle of drug addicted geese. These geese took 
his legs away from him. As he rolled out of the cave he knew that from then out it would be his life's calling to get revenge.
	This is how it all started, and this is how Jack is fueled. His calling evolved a little more as time went on, but the essence of violence
never left him. No one will ever underestimate Jack again, well they might, but they WILL be sorry, for he has the element of surprise at his "feet".
It's been six whole years since the attack, but that flame of passion hasn't died, not even close. He trains for 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, while
bird hunting on the side. His body is at peak performance...far beyound any mere human is capable of.
